## General info
A top down shooter for Andoid and desktop. Made 3 enemy bot types (with varying speed, health & damage) by tweaking an N-body simulation algorithm. The game has a variable enemy spawn rate so difficult increases as the game progresses. Available on the Google Play Store: https://bit.ly/3BcxFNy

Note: this program was written in 2017, before I had any formal experience with programming. The quality of code (commenting, variables names, project structure, etc) reflects that.
